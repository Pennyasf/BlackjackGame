A very basic blackjack game, you do not get to be the player but get to choose how many players will participate.
The game should start after you run it in a terminal with 'python black_jack.py' and input a number of players
The game should print the players and their cards when significant events occur - eg a winner, a bust, or the final leaderboard
The game should also say if a player is 'hit' or 'stand' when it comes to getting extra cards - the players decision to hit or stand is currently based on a random generator
There are some test cases, however I would implement more if this were to be a real client project
